## PRs
If you want to PR your change in, I will accept if:
- YOU DO NOT INCLUDE EXTERNAL LIBRARIES (no jquery or any "custom" javascript libraries)
- Your code is coherent and functionality is useful
- You don't increase the permissions required in the manifest.json
- You don't make calls to external APIs, if you want features like that, just fork the project and make your own extension.
